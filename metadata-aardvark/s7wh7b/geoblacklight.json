        "This index provides access to a set of digital versions of print source map sheets from the topographic map series Bangladesh 1:50,000. There is complete national coverage of Bangladesh through 269 sheets issued in various editions between 1959-2005. The source maps were published by Sārve aba Bāṃlādeśa, the Survey of Bangladesh. Land Info scanned, cropped, georeferenced, and published these digital versions of the maps in 2017. The sheets show water features, relief, vegetation, communication, and other cultural features. Along with each georeferenced version, a full, un-georeferenced version is provided as a supplmentary documentation file. The sheet margins include a legend, grid reference, magnetic declination information, administrative boundaries diagram, and index to adjoining sheets."
