The attributes include calculations of the building area, mean elevation of the base, and mean elevation of the top of the building. It was downloaded from the City of Hayward (California) Open Data Portal in February 2019 by the University of California Berkeley Library as part of the California Open Data project. The data was reported on the website it was downloaded from to be last updated on June 26, 2018 and published on February 23, 2017."
