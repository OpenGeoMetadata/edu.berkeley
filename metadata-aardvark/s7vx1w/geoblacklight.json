        "The Mongolian 20th-century Historical GIS Database project was designed to create datasets that could integrate and align well together. The collectionâ€™s datasets can be used for creating small to medium size maps of historical Mongolia and for analysis, as appropriate to the resolution. This data is only as accurate as the source maps upon which it is based. As such, the UC Berkeley Library does not guarantee the accuracy of the data. Researchers should use their own judgment about appropriate uses for this data."
