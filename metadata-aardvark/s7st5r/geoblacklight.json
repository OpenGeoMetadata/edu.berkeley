The digital versions have been scanned, cropped to the map area, georeferenced, and published by Land Info. Contour intervals are shown at 10 meters. Text is in English and Dutch. The original print sheets were published as part of the map series Topografische kaart van de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba 1:25,000, republished in Amsterdam by Rudolf Muller in 1995. The maps are based on fieldwork by the Dienst van het Kadaster (Nederlandse Antillen) and aerial photography flown by KLM Aerocarto."
