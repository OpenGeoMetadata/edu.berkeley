    "The marshes and wetlands dataset represents the Open Space and Resource Conservation Biotic Resources Habitat Areas Element 3.1 of the Sonoma County General Plan 2020 as adopted on September 23, 2008 by Resolution No. 08-0808. The marshes and wetlands is one of four types of biotic habitats which assist in identifying and preserving natural and diverse biotic resource habitat areas from adverse effects of human activities. The Wetlands are transitional areas between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and include marshes, vernal pools, seeps, springs, and portions of riparian corridors with wetland vegetation. Wetlands are recognized for their high fish and wildlife habitat values, occurrences of unique plant and animal species, and importance in water recharge and filtration. Wetlands meeting certain criteria are subject to regulations of the US Army Corps of Engineers, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), CDFG, or applicable Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Wetland areas mapped as part of the National Wetlands Inventory and other sources include the Laguna de Santa Rosa, vernal pools, San Pablo Bay and Petaluma marshes, coastal and tidal marshes, and such freshwater marshes as the Pitkin, Kenwood, Cunningham, and Atascadero Marshes. Detailed delineations are typically necessary to confirm the presence and extent of any jurisdictional wetlands. The Biotic Habitat Areas designated on Figures OSRC-5a through 5i (http://www.sonoma-county.org/prmd/gp2020/adopted/index.htm) depict the habitats whose locations are known and considered important for protection at this time. However, the biotic habitat policies provide for protection of biotic habitats both within and outside designated areas. Currently available information on the location and value of native habitats and sensitive resources is incomplete and changes over time as sites are assessed, new occurrences are reported, and additional locations are identified. As more habitat mapping information becomes available in the future, changes in designations will be considered along with possible policy changes. Regular collection and updating of reliable information and refinement of best management practices are necessary to protect the County's biotic resources over the long term. The intent of the plan is that policies, guidelines, and standards be clear and direct so that property owners and citizens may easily understand its provisions and how they apply to parcels of land as well as their cumulative impact on future environmental conditions and quality of life. The broad purpose of the Sonoma County General Plan is to express policies which will guide decisions on future growth, development, and conservation of resources through 2020 in a manner consistent with the goals and quality of life desired by the county's residents. Under State law many actions on private land development, such as specific plans, area plans, zoning, subdivisions, public agency projects and other decisions must be consistent with the general plan. The goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the plan will be applied in a manner to insure their constitutionality. Per Title 7, Division 1 of the Government Code of the State of California. Article 5, Section 65300 et seq, the County of Sonoma is required to adopt a comprehensive general plan to guide its future physical development. Therefore, as required by law, the 2020 Sonoma County General Plan was officially adopted on September 23, 2008.
