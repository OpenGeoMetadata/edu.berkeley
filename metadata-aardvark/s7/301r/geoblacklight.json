    "California regions developed by the Inter-agency Natural Areas Coordinating Committee (INACC) were digitized from a 1:1,200,000 California Department of Fish and Game paper map. The 2004 update utilizes the 1:24,000-scale county boundaries, coastline and state boundary from the  CMCC Framework data layer CNTY24K97_1. The North and South Sierra bioregions have also been collapsed to form one region,Sierra."
