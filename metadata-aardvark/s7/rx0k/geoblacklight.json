    "This polygonal dataset shows all lakes, large rivers, and small water bodies within Butte County, California as shown on USGS 1:24000 maps and updates from aerial photography. NOTE: Other shapefiles are created from this base file. If you are reading metadata from the following shapefiles, only a portion of this metadata will pertain to those files since they are sub sets of this base file. 1) Lakes.shp only shows those water bodies with a proper name and are not designated as a river. 2) River_poly.shp only shows those polygons representing river features."
