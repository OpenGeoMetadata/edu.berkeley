    "Street centerline data. Actual and exhaustive street ranges, zip codes and cities for both sides of each street segment. Constructed in conjunction with our parcel basemap. Centerlines are typically at the computed center of the parcel right-of-way lines. They are defined with AutoCad operations, whose quality control is rigorously maintained. They are converted to ArcView shape files."
