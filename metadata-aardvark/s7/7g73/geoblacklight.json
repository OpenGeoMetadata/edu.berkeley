    "Digital index to filed maps used by the County of Napa. Maps such as Records of Survey and Sub-division maps are included.\nAll of the filed maps were scanned by the Napa County Recorder's Office. A center point for each map was determined by examining the scanned map and visually locating it using roads, parcels and other GIS layers as references. A radius was then assigned to each point that approximates the extent of the map. Finally, a circle was created based on the center point and radius."
