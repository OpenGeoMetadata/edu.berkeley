    "The Napa County Watersheds were generated from two elevation datasets.  The Napa River Watershed was generated from LIDAR data processed by NCALM at UC Berkeley (http://calm.geo.berkeley.edu/ncalm/index.html).  The eastern side of the county was delineated from DTM data which was generated from aerial photography (2002).  The watersheds are intended to be used for hydrologic modeling and planning."
