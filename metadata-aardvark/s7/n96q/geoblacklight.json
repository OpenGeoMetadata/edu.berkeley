    "This dataset contains boundaries for water bodies in Amador County, California. This data set was derived from the USGS 1:100,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (http://nhd.usgs.gov/), keeping all the attribution from that dataset but redigitizing the boundaries to the 1-ft resolution 2006 orthophotos obtained from AirPhoto USA for Amador County. This update process has not been completed. The field \"Updated2Ortho\" contains a value of '2006' for water bodies which have been updated. Water bodies for which this field has no value appear exactly as in the original National Hydrology Dataset."
