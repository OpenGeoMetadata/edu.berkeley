    "Dam Inundation maps for the State of California are required by California  Government Code Section 8589.5(b).\nInundation potential to cause damage to life and property is mapped for individual dams. Dam inundation maps\nshow the maximum extent of damage of a flood wave emanating from a dam failure. The map does not indicate or\ninfer the probability of such an event occurring.\n\nThis data set represents a combined, statewide shapefile of all the dam inundation boundaries in the state.  It\nserves as a quick index to locating all dam inundation boundaries in a particular area, or the geography of a\nparticular inundation boundary, or group of boundaries.  This shapefile is updated from time to time, and is\ncurrently located in New_CD\\06_CD\\Data\\Arc\\dam_inundation_digitizing_mrg_07.shp  It has a polyline geometry\nstructure, and dam-name attribution."
