    "The fire protection responsibility area dataset represents areas of legal responsibility for fire protection, including State Responsibility Areas (SRA), Federal Responsibility Areas (FRA), and Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) within Sonoma County. Please note, the fire protection responsibility areas are created, maintained and governed by the California Department of Forestry (CDF) and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).. The California Department of Forestry (CDF) has a legal responsibility to provide fire protection on all State Responsibility Area (SRA) lands, which are defined based on land ownership, population density and land use. For example, CDF does not have responsibility for densely populated areas, agricultural lands, or lands administered by the federal government. To more efficiently provide protection over a more contiguous land base, CDF swaps protection areas with other providers, with the resulting lands being called CDF Direct Protection Area (DPA). SRA designations undergo a thorough 5 year review cycle, as well as annual updates for incorporations. Related Resource: CAL FIRE Web Homepage http://www.fire.ca.gov/"
