    "dc_description_s": "These Public Lands should NOT be represented as survey data, and the official record of survey takes precedence where there are discrepancies.  It is the end user's responsibility to check the accuracy of the GIS data by comparing it with the published data from the Sonoma County Assessor / Recorder office.  NO DETERMINATION REGARDING PUBLIC ACCESS IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THIS LAYER\n\nThis layer was compiled from two primary sources; the County seamless parcel base and the orthophotography.  In some cases the public land areas were heads up rectified to the orthophotography and in others the public lands were extracted form a megabyte parcel join.  The Original layer was created to support the 1989 version of the Open Space Element of the General Plan, and some of the lands depicted in this area are from the original pre-rectified state of the parcel base prior to rectification to the orthophotography.  However, this layer has been updated to include city parks and some other modifications to the public lands.  Many however will need to be updated as the parcels are rectified.\n\nThe Sonoma County parcel base was originally compiled from Assessor Parcel maps at a scale of 1:6000.  The individual Assessor Parcel maps were enlarged or reduced in size using an electrostatic process to produce the maps at the 1:6000 scale, the maps were then fit together by hand and transcribed on to mylar.  The mylar base consisted of 1:6000 USGS base map information typically found on the 7.5 USGS quad series.  This base information consisted of Topography, Roads, Section, and Rancho lines to name some.  Using this information, the Assessor Parcel maps were fit to the individual 1:6000 scale maps.  Each 1:6000 scale map represents 1/6 (quad sixths) of a 7.5 minute USGS Quadrangle series map.\n\nIn 1998 the State Board of Equalization provided the impetus to produce the Russian River Project for all of Planning Area 4.  One aspect required for this project was a digital parcel base for planning area 4.  This involved the conversion of the 1:6000 mylars with the transcribed parcels on them into a digital version of the parcels.  The mylars were scanned and geo-referenced using the base map information originally included with the 1:6000 mylar base.  The maps were geo-referenced to a digital version of the USGS 7.5 minute Quadrangle series available from the Teal Data Center.  The original projection was California State Plan Zone 2 NAD 1927.  County Staff then used AutoCAD software to heads up digitize each 1:6000 scale map in planning area 4.\n\nA custom application was created and used by GIS staff involving the use of avenue and ArcView 3.2 to create a point for all the parcels in planning area 4, attributes included Assessor Parcel Number.  The DWGs were then converted to shapefiles and then converted to ArcINFO coverages, the parcel tags were converted from shapefiles to ArcINFO coverages and the point coverage was merged with the polygon coverage with the IDENTITY command.  An exhaustive process was involved to eliminate errors once the DWGs were converted to ArcINFO coverages so polygons could be generated.  The coverages were then aggregated using the MAPJOIN command, the original boundary of the 1:6000 scale maps was removed using the  REGIONDISSOLVE command to merge adjacent polygons with the same AP number.  In 1999 the remainder of the planning areas were converted to digital form following the Russian River Project and the seamless base was completed in 2001.  The seamless parcel base was maintained in ArcINFO until the release of ArcGIS 8.3, which included topology tools necessary for its maintenance.\n\nThe seamless base prior to late 2002 was suitable for 1:100000 scale while the control points (the corners for the 1:6000 scale maps) were suitable for 1:24000 scale.\n\nPending continued funding, the County is correcting the parcels to the orthophotography generated in April - May 2000.  The parcel data were derived from 1:6000 scale maps and digitized in California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 27 coordinates (survey feet), but were converted to California State Plane, Zone II, NAD 83 coordinates (survey feet) as part of a rectification process now underway.  \nThe parcels currently use the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle (1:24,000) series for coordinate control, but no guarantee is made for their spatial accuracy.  The data were re-projected to NAD 83 coordinates to overlay the orthophotography, but the parcel boundaries will not correspond precisely with features in the images.\n\nThe parcels are currently being rectified to orthophoto, a complete description of the process is detailed in a series of documents located on a local file server: S:\\COMMON\\GIS\\Documentation\\Parcel Rectification   Update Process\\Procedure - *. doc.  A brief summary is as follows.  Individual Assessor Parcel pages or CAD drawings are rectified to the orthophoto.  COGO   survey data are used when available and in sufficient quantities to enable the bulk of an Assessor Parcel page to be digitized using said information.  Polygons are generated directly from the COGO data, CAD dwg are exported to feature classes, where polygons are then generated, rectified Assessor Parcel pages are vectorized using ArcScan and subsequently polygons are generated.  A spatial join is used to attributes to the newly generated polygons.  Polygons are then assigned an accuracy rank based on source, quality of the fit to the orthophoto, and RMS error encountered during rectification (only the Scanned Assessor map will have and RMS error associated with them) See the fields RANK and DESCRIPTION for information on fit assessment.  \n\nAreas that have been successfully updated as such have a reasonable expectation of accuracy of +/- 10 and possibly better, areas that have not been updated or are flagged in SCAMP (http://sc-gis/web/scamp/browse.jsp) under the GIS group Projects as Needs Survey Data, the original accuracy assessment of 1:100000 applies.",
