    "dc_description_s": "The habitat connectivity corridors dataset represents the Open Space and Resource Conservation Biotic Resources Habitat Areas Element 3.1 of the Sonoma County General Plan 2020 as adopted on September 23, 2008 by Resolution No. 08-0808. The habitat connectivity corridors is one of four types of biotic habitats which assist in identifying and preserving natural and diverse biotic resource habitat areas from adverse effects of human activities. The maintaining and improving opportunities for habitat connectivity throughout the County is essential for protecting biodiversity and sustaining native plant and animal populations. Linkages and corridors are needed to allow movement across the landscape and to connect wetlands and other important habitat areas to undeveloped lands and permanent open space. Important linkages and corridors include lands south of Glen Ellen connecting Sonoma Mountain and the Mayacamas Range and lands connecting the Laguna de Santa Rosa to agricultural areas south of Highway 116. The Biotic Habitat Areas designated on Figures OSRC-5a through 5i (http://www.sonoma-county.org/prmd/gp2020/adopted/index.htm) depict the habitats whose locations are known and considered important for protection at this time. However, the biotic habitat policies provide for protection of biotic habitats both within and outside designated areas. Currently available information on the location and value of native habitats and sensitive resources is incomplete and changes over time as sites are assessed, new occurrences are reported, and additional locations are identified. As more habitat mapping information becomes available in the future, changes in designations will be considered along with possible policy changes. Regular collection and updating of reliable information and refinement of best management practices are necessary to protect the County's biotic resources over the long term. The intent of the plan is that policies, guidelines, and standards be clear and direct so that property owners and citizens may easily understand its provisions and how they apply to parcels of land as well as their cumulative impact on future environmental conditions and quality of life. The broad purpose of the Sonoma County General Plan is to express policies which will guide decisions on future growth, development, and conservation of resources through 2020 in a manner consistent with the goals and quality of life desired by the county's residents. Under State law many actions on private land development, such as specific plans, area plans, zoning, subdivisions, public agency projects and other decisions must be consistent with the general plan. The goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the plan will be applied in a manner to insure their constitutionality. Per Title 7, Division 1 of the Government Code of the State of California. Article 5, Section 65300 et seq, the County of Sonoma is required to adopt a comprehensive general plan to guide its future physical development. Therefore, as required by law, the 2020 Sonoma County General Plan was officially adopted on September 23, 2008.
