This parcel base was developed as base for GIS development for Placer County, i.e.: city limits, supervisorial boundaries, zoning, sewer and more. This base is designed to be attached to the Assessor's Megabyte Database by using the Feeparcel (Assessor's Parcel Number) for analysis purposes. The parcel boundaries are rectified to the GPS_Roads GIS data for the County. The parcels are NOT COGO accurate. This feature was prepared for Geographic Information purposes only, and is not intended to illustrate legal building sites, or supercede local ordinances. Official information concerning the size or use of any parcel should be obtained from recorded documents and local governing agencies.",
