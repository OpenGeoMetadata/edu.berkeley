The layer was developed between 2003 and 2008 based on Ortho-photography from the same years. Structures that were visible on the orthos were traced. The City of Santa Cruz and Watsonville had their footprints mapped by a consultant. The rest of the county was done by a combination of interns and County GIS staff. The primary purpose was for Fire Modeling and disaster preparedness. ",
