While the individual features files have not been updated since their development, the citywide file was updated to reflect changes along the Embarcardero corridor and along King St. Please note that the sidewalk widths (curbs) were derived from project working drawings and may not be as-builts conditions.  There are plans by DPW to update the layers found in the features drawings.",
