See Data Quality - Attribute Accuracy tab for boundary modification history. A \"sphere of influence\" is a physical boundary a local governmental agency is expected to provide services for and is generally set by Sonoma LAFCO with a 20-year time frame. Sphere of influence boundaries are designated in order to help discourage urban sprawl, limit boundary disputes between local agencies, and provides indications regarding future development potential. A district or City's SOI should not to be construed as \"referral\" areas or as bestowing authority and control in the sphere area. LAFCO can amend a SOI if there are sound reasons to do so.",
