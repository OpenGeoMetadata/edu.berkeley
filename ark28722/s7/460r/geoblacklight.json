Lynx compiled the parcel layer from County AutoCAD drawings and Fire Run maps as well as electronic data supplied by Cities within the County. The final layer was adjusted to best fit the County\u0092s 200-scale orthophotography base. Street name attribution was derived from multiple sources. Farallon Geographics converted all data from ARC/Info coverages into Oracle Spatial. San Mateo County Public Works Department currently maintains the streets layer.",
